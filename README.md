# SpaceCadets-COMP1202
Besides the Programming I course in my first semester, there was an optional course for students with previous experience in programming that included weekly challenges that explored more advanced topics. The course was also a survival competition for the students who can complete the most challenges in the 9 weeks. I made it into top 5 out of the initial 50 participants :)

Below is a general breakdown of each challenge with a more detailed Readme in its folder.

## Challenges Breakdown

### Challenge I
Unfortunately, I have the bad habbit of pushing authentication tokens to public repositories. After panicking I purged my repository containing my solution to the challenge using Selenium and Java. No local backup was available so the code was lost forever. ***RIP***

Task: Write a Web service to Fetch an email ID and get a person's name

Description: Have a look at the Web page at https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/dem. This is a departmental information page which gives all sorts of information about a member of staff. The Web address is constructed from a departmental email id (in this case dem). If I have someone else's email id, I can look up their name from one of these Web pages. Try it with your own email id. In fact, in the past the name started at the 12th character of the 6th line of the HTML data returned by the Web server. It finishes when a '<' character appears. (Choose 'View Source' from your Web browser to check where it is now.)
