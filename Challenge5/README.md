# Challenge V

**_Task:_ Write an applet that makes spirographs**

***Description:*** The challenge this week is to create a virtual version of a "Spirograph" (a childrens toy back in the dark ages). A Spirograph consisted of a set of small toothed wheels that rolled around the inside of larger wheels. You put a pen inside a hole in the smaller wheels and drew out a pattern as it looped around the bigger wheel. Your challenge is to write an Applet or JApplet or AWT application or Swing application or JavaFX application that draws a simple hypercycloid.

In this challenge I'd like you to focus on creating an Object Oriented solution. For example, you might create a separate class that represents a hypocycloid, which has instance variables for (among other things) the radius of the circles. Your class should provide a sensible constructor so that a hypocycloid of a particular shape can be easily created. The class should provide a paint() method so that it can be easily drawn by the applet's paint() method.

***Result:***
